# CV Creator React App

# Project Description

Online CV Creator built using React library. I implemented newly learnt concepts, such as:
🕸️Class Components
🕸️Functional Components
🕸️Props 
🕸️State
🕸️Hooks

I can clearly see the benefit of using React over Vanilla JS. Working with reusable components ensures faster, beter structured and more optimised development.
